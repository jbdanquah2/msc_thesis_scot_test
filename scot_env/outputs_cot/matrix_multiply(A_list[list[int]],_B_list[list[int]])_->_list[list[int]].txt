### Reasoning
To multiply two matrices A and B, we need to follow the matrix multiplication rules. The number of columns in matrix A must be equal to the number of rows in matrix B in order to perform multiplication.

We will initialize a result matrix with dimensions equal to the number of rows in A and the number of columns in B. Then, we will iterate through the rows of A and the columns of B, multiplying and summing the corresponding elements to populate the result matrix.

### Final Code
```python
def matrix_multiply(A: list[list[int]], B: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
    # Get dimensions of matrices
    rows_A = len(A)
    cols_A = len(A[0])
    cols_B = len(B[0])
    
    # Initialize result matrix with zeros
    result = [[0 for _ in range(cols_B)] for _ in range(rows_A)]
    
    # Perform matrix multiplication
    for i in range(rows_A):
        for j in range(cols_B):
            for k in range(cols_A):
                result[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]
    
    return result
```
