### Reasoning
To multiply two matrices A and B, we need to ensure that the number of columns in matrix A is equal to the number of rows in matrix B. Once we have validated the dimensions, we can then perform the multiplication by iterating through the elements of the matrices and calculating the dot product of the corresponding rows and columns.

### Final Code
```python
def matrix_multiply(A: list[list[int]], B: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
    # Validate dimensions for multiplication
    if len(A[0]) != len(B):
        raise ValueError("Invalid dimensions for matrix multiplication")

    # Initialize result matrix with dimensions of rows of A and columns of B
    result = [[0 for _ in range(len(B[0]))] for _ in range(len(A))]

    # Perform matrix multiplication
    for i in range(len(A)):
        for j in range(len(B[0])):
            for k in range(len(B)):
                result[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]

    return result
```
