### Reasoning
To count the number of vowels in a given string, I will iterate through each character in the string and check if it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u). If it is, I will increment a counter variable. Finally, I will return the counter variable as the result.

### Final Code
```python
def count_vowels(s: str) -> int:
    vowels = "aeiou"
    count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.lower() in vowels:
            count += 1
    return count
```
