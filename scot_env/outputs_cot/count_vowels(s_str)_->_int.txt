### Reasoning
I will start by defining a function that takes a string as input and returns the count of vowels in the string. I will initialize a variable to count the vowels and then iterate through the string to check each character. If the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), I will increment the count. Finally, I will return the count of vowels.

### Final Code
```python
def count_vowels(s: str) -> int:
    """
    Return the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the given string.
    """
    count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.lower() in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']:
            count += 1
    return count
```
