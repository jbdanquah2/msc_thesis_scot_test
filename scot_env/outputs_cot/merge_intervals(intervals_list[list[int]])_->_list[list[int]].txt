### Reasoning
To solve this task, we can follow these steps:
1. Sort the intervals based on the start time of each interval.
2. Initialize an empty list to store the merged intervals.
3. Iterate through the sorted intervals and merge the overlapping intervals.
4. Return the list of merged intervals.

### Final Code
```python
def merge_intervals(intervals: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
    if not intervals:
        return []
    
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # Sort the intervals based on start time
    
    merged = [intervals[0]]  # Initialize the merged list with the first interval
    
    for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
        if intervals[i][0] <= merged[-1][1]:  # Check for overlap
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], intervals[i][1])  # Merge the intervals
        else:
            merged.append(intervals[i])  # Add non-overlapping intervals to the merged list
    
    return merged
```
